# Spectral-Image-Segmentation-with-N-Cut-Algorithm
This repository implements spectral image segmentation using the Normalized Cut (N-cut) algorithm with PyTorch and scikit-image. The implementation includes variants using both basic intensity-based similarity and Gaussian similarity incorporating spatial and color proximity.
